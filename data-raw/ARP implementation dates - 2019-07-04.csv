1,Additional triage time pilot programme service. Six services used the same additional triage time and operational processes from October 2015.,,,,
2,"London began some pilot work using variable additional triage time in February 2015. London were not consistent in their use of additional triage time until the beginning of the larger pilot programme, see Note 1.",,,,

4,"Revised call categories pilot programme site (3 sites). Revised call categories underwent two changes during the pilot period before the categories were finalised. However, these changes to the new categories are unlikely to have affected the categorisation of the highest severity calls (e.g. cardiac arrest). For completeness, we list the dates of changes to these new categories: South West - 2016-10-24; West Midlands - 2016-10-17; Yorkshire - 2016-10-24.",,,,
